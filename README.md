Just a webapp I'm working on for a class.  
  
For context: students look up their grades on a public sheet by calculating a  
hash using student id, last name, college, and major (using the SHA1 algo).  

I thought it would be helpful to have a site that guides users through each  
input, at least it would eliminate some human error in inputting the wrong  
college/major code or not uppercasing correctly.
